# Agent Operations Report

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-24 19:33 UTC

## âœ… Completed Actions
- Sanitized `mcp.json` by replacing the embedded Codacy API token with an environment-variable placeholder so credentials are never persisted in source control.
- Reviewed workflow and environment configuration to confirm all remaining secrets are referenced through GitHub Actions secrets or runtime inputs without plaintext exposure.
- Verified security posture of existing MCP toolbox and agent scripts to ensure they continue to respect environment isolation and do not leak sensitive values during execution.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Recommended Steps
1. Add automated secret scanning (e.g., `trufflehog` or `gitleaks`) to CI to prevent future accidental credential commits.
2. Provide onboarding documentation that explains how to supply runtime secrets (Codacy, OpenRouter, Notion) using `.env` files or repository secrets without hardcoding values.
3. Implement unit tests for the MCP toolbox to validate sanitization logic and environment fallbacks across supported execution environments.
