# Agent Operations Report

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-24 19:33 UTC

## âœ… Completed Actions
- Sanitized `mcp.json` by replacing the embedded Codacy API token with an environment-variable placeholder so credentials are never persisted in source control.
- Reviewed workflow and environment configuration to confirm all remaining secrets are referenced through GitHub Actions secrets or runtime inputs without plaintext exposure.
- Verified security posture of existing MCP toolbox and agent scripts to ensure they continue to respect environment isolation and do not leak sensitive values during execution.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Recommended Steps
1. Add automated secret scanning (e.g., `trufflehog` or `gitleaks`) to CI to prevent future accidental credential commits.
2. Provide onboarding documentation that explains how to supply runtime secrets (Codacy, OpenRouter, Notion) using `.env` files or repository secrets without hardcoding values.
3. Implement unit tests for the MCP toolbox to validate sanitization logic and environment fallbacks across supported execution environments.

## âœ… Completed Actions
- Refactored the chat interface so asynchronous effects no longer reference callbacks before initialization, eliminating runtime `ReferenceError` crashes and ensuring safe state access across browsers.
- Hardened chat API interactions by checking HTTP status codes, guarding against undefined chat IDs, and logging anomalous responses so failed requests cannot silently drop messages.
- Audited the operational insight card implementation to confirm Mermaid diagrams render in strict mode with SVG sanitization, CLI commands honor allow/block rules, and no new secrets were introduced.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Recommended Steps
1. Add integration coverage for the operational insight card to automatically exercise CLI validation, undo timers, and Mermaid sanitization in CI.
2. Introduce request-level abort controllers or SWR caching for chat fetches to prevent state updates on unmounted components in slow or offline environments.
3. Expand security documentation to capture the card systemâ€™s sandbox guarantees and provide runbooks for rotating tokens referenced in `mcp.json` inputs.
